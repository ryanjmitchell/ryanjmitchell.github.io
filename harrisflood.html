			<h1><b>Harris County, Texas</b></h1>
			<h2>Critical infrastructure that has a 1-in-500 (0.2%) chance of flooding</h2>
			<!-- Harris Flood Map -->
			<p style="text-align:left;">FEMA defines 500-year floodplains as those that have a 1-in-500 or 0.2% annual chance of flooding. In Harris County, these 500-year events are happening more frequently, three have occurred successively: 2015, 2016, and 2017. With another 500-year flood occurring in 2001.

			The city of Houston, situated in Harris County, is the most populated city in the state of Texas and the fourth most in the United States with a population of over 2.3 million people. Another 4.6 million live in the Greater Houston area. Many of those living in Harris County and Greater Houston would be affected negatively by extreme flooding.
				<br>
				Harris Countyâ€™s flat terrain, large amounts of impervious cover (concrete and asphalt), slow-absorbing soil, and potential for thunderstorms, tropical storms, and hurricanes all combine to form ideal conditions for flooding. Located in humid-subtropical climate and with its proximity to the coast, Harris County is susceptible to a large amount of rainfall that is often too great for its infrastructure and bayous to handle. Once the regions ditch and stormwater networks are inundated with runoff, streets then become secondary drainage facilities.</p>
